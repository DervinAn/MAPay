# MAPay - React Payment Application

A modern payment application built with React and Vite.

## Development

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

2. **Automatic Deployment:**
   - The project will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch
   - The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/MAPay/`

3. **Manual Deployment:**
   - You can also trigger deployment manually from the Actions tab in your GitHub repository

### Build Configuration

The project is configured with the correct base path (`/MAPay/`) for GitHub Pages deployment in `vite.config.js`.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
